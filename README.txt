To run each model, simply run all code blocks in main.ipynb from start to finish. 

csv files titled, 'logistic_regression.csv', 'naive_bayes.csv' and 'random_forest.csv'
will be produced onto the root of the folder

If separate models were to be created, please locate in the 'main.ipynb' file for the 
model name, and run the code under the headings after the text preprocessing and feature selection processes.

the test predictions, in kaggle format can be found in the test_predictions folder
